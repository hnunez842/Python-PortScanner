# Python PortScanner

## Objective

Develop and present a Python-based port scanner to demonstrate the importance of port scanning during the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test, including mapping the attack surface, identifying running services and versions, and using the results to prioritize targets and support further security analysis.

## Skills Developed

- **Network Reconnaissance & Attack Surface Mapping**  
  Gained an understanding of how port scanning supports the reconnaissance stage by identifying open ports, exposed services, and potential entry points into a target environment.
  
- **Port Scanning Concepts & Tooling**  
  Explored common port scanning tools. 

- **Python Scripting for Network Security**  
  Implemented a Python script to automate port scanning tasks, leveraging Python’s readability and libraries (e.g., socket / Nmap integrations) to scan open ports, services, and versions.

- **Interpreting Scan Results for Security Posture**  
  Learned how to interpret port scan output to detect misconfigurations, unnecessary open ports, and services that may increase the organization’s risk profile.
  
- **Security Hardening & Best Practices**  
  Identified key recommendations such as closing unnecessary ports, restricting access with firewall rules, enforcing strong authentication and encryption, keeping services updated, and implementing intrusion detection and logging.  

## Tools Used

- **Python** – Used to develop a custom port scanner script for automating network scanning tasks.    
- **Nmap** – Industry-standard tool referenced for comparison and functionality benchmarking in port scanning.    
- **Masscan** – High-speed scanner highlighted for large-scale or Internet-wide scanning use cases.    
- **Netcat** – Discussed as a flexible networking utility often called the “Swiss Army knife” of networking.  
- **Unicornscan** – Referenced for its ability to efficiently gather detailed information on open ports.
